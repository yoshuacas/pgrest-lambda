description: Audit and improve an existing design document. Use after a design doc has been drafted to verify technical accuracy, find gaps, and fix issues.

## Purpose

Review a design document for correctness, completeness, and
consistency, then apply fixes directly to the document.

## Process

### 1. Research

Before evaluating the design, build domain knowledge:

- Search the web for relevant documentation on APIs, behaviors,
  limits, and best practices that relate to the design.
- Read the project's existing design documents in `docs/design/`
  to understand established patterns and conventions.
- Read relevant source code to verify that types, file paths,
  and service methods referenced in the design actually exist
  or are plausible extensions of the current architecture.

### 2. Evaluate

Check the design for:

- **Factual accuracy**: Do behaviors described in the design
  match actual documentation and API semantics? Are limits,
  default values, and semantics correct?
- **Internal consistency**: Do the CX examples match the
  technical design? Do error messages reference the right
  names and types? Do file change lists cover all sections
  that describe modifications?
- **Completeness**: Are all validation rules specified? Are
  error messages provided for every failure case? Does the
  testing strategy cover the described behaviors?
- **Sharp edges**: Are there edge cases not addressed? Race
  conditions? Conflicting behaviors with existing features?
  Ambiguous specifications that could be interpreted multiple
  ways?
- **Underspecification**: Are there sections that say "TBD" or
  leave decisions open that should be resolved? Are default
  values specified? Are boundary conditions defined?
- **Test specificity risk**: For each test scenario
  in the testing strategy, consider whether the
  same observable result could be produced by a
  different code path (e.g., pattern resolution vs
  PK pool assignment). If so, add a note to the
  test scenario flagging the risk — not as an error
  in the design, but as guidance to the task worker
  that it may need to adjust the test after writing
  and running it to ensure it targets the correct
  behavior. Example note: "⚠ This test's expected
  output could also be produced by [alternative
  path]. The implementing agent should verify the
  test exercises [intended path] and adjust
  assertions or test setup if needed."

### 3. Fix

Apply corrections directly to the design document:

- Fix factual errors with correct information from documentation.
- Resolve inconsistencies by making the document internally
  coherent.
- Add missing validation rules, error messages, or edge case
  handling.
- Clarify ambiguous specifications with concrete decisions.
- Move genuinely open questions to the Open Questions section
  rather than leaving them inline.
- Do not remove content that is correct; only add, clarify,
  or correct.

### 4. Summary

After making changes, provide a brief summary of what was
found and fixed. Do not write a long report — just list the
key issues addressed.
